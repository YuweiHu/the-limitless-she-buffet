            In Taiwanese online discourse, the phrase &ldquo;eating the feminist
            buffet&rdquo; ( 吃女權自助餐 ) has become a common insult, used to
            accuse women of being inconsistent—advocating for gender equality in
            some situations while enjoying traditional privileges in others.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term originated from American comedian Bill Burr, who mocked
            this behavior in a stand-up performance:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 my-6 italic text-gray-600">
            <p>
              All they (the girls) want is the good shit of being a guy.
              They&apos;re cherry‑picking. They&apos;re looking at guys&apos;
              life like it&apos;s a buffet, right? Like you just could start
              picking out stuff, like &lsquo;Same amount an hour? we&apos;ll
              take some of that. Pay for the movie? Fuck that—you can keep
              that.&rsquo;
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            What began as a sarcastic jab gradually morphed—through translation
            and repetition—into a form of language that no longer allows for
            contradiction or vulnerability. It doesn&apos;t ask how power
            operates. It doesn&apos;t care about the trade-offs behind those
            so-called &ldquo;choices.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead, it sorts and labels women&apos;s experiences, flattening
            them into categories made for criticism.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Limitless She Buffet</strong> emerges from this cultural
            moment—an attempt to reclaim the metaphor of the buffet, once used
            as insult, and reframe it as a space of perception and witnessing.
            This is a table already set: each &ldquo;dish&rdquo; is an untold
            story, waiting to be seen, remembered, and read.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project was initiated by artist Tzu-en Hsu (Ani Syu), drawing on
            her lived experience of subtle gendered tension, relationship
            fatigue, and creative constraint. She transforms these into symbolic
            &ldquo;dishes,&rdquo; and serves them in an interactive buffet-style
            installation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here, viewing is no longer passive. It becomes a selection, a
            participation, a moment of shared weight, embodied in a thermal
            receipt that cannot be easily thrown away.
          </p>

          <p>
            After completing the first series, Ani invited three female creators
            from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea to join this &ldquo;limitless she
            buffet.&rdquo; Each artist began with her own experiences, writing
            and conceptualizing three to four symbolic dishes, which Ani helped
            translate into physical forms for display.

            These works move between truth and metaphor, text and object, memory
            and invention— they cannot be categorized, nor do they speak on
            behalf of any collective.
